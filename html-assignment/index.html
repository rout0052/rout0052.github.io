        <p> My name is Taro Routly (he/they) and I am very excited to jump back into HTML! I did a lot of HTML in high school, but I haven't done any major HTML projects in a few years. I am a multidiscplinary artist, varying from digital illustration & 3D modelling & animation, to audio production, cosplay and jewelry making! I was previously enrolled in the <abbr title="Bachelor of Information Technology: Interactive Multimedia Design">BIT IMD</abbr> joint program with Carleton and Algonquin. However, after finishing my 1<sup>st</sup> semester, I realized that the college program was a far better fit for me in accessibility, time, and cost.</p>
        
        <p> Outside of the school, I <em>love</em> reading, both fiction and nonfiction, with some of my favourite authors being Leah Lakshmi Piepzna-Samarasinha, Leigh Bardugo (Six Of Crows), Tamsyn Muir (The Locked Tomb), Jordan Ifueko (Raybearer), and Andrew Joseph White (Hell Followed With Us). I adore <abbr title="Tabletop Roleplaying Games">TTRPGs</abbr> like Dungeons & Dragons as well as actual play shows like Dimension 20, Trials & Trebuchets, Not Another DND Podcast, Warding Bond and Worlds Beyond Number. Since moving to Ottawa in the fall, I was able to join my partner's DND campaign, which is my first time playing in a long term campaign! Audio dramas are also an art form I am <em>extremely</em> passionate about, having created a few in high school. My favourites are Camp Here & There, The Magnus Archives, and The Attic Monologues! Finally, I am incredibly passionate about activism and advocacy, and believe that intersectionality is crucial to our liberation!</p>
